# Playing Minecraft on Windows 98
Here's a short tutorial on how to play MC on Windows 98.

## System Requirements
- Pentium 4 or Core2 processor.
- Ethernet
- GeForce FX 5000 or 6000 series gpu or equivalent. Might work with patched GeForce 7000 series but untested.
- USB/external storage device support
- At least 768MB of ram
- Optional: SSD and HDD

## Vanilla OS Steps
1. Download java 5 from here.
2. Download Betacraft from here. I will update when Betacraft recieves official java 5 support in a later update. Note: Unless you want to patch your operating system you can not log in due to ssl cert issues.
3. Download and run Minecraft. Everything should work fine.

## Modified OS Steps (With KernelEx and Java 6)
1. Download java 6 from here.
2. Download Betacraft from [here](https://github.com/Moresteck/BetaCraft-Launcher-Java/releases). If you have still not migrated to a Microsoft account download the official Minecraft Launcher from [here](https://launcher.mojang.com/v1/objects/eabbff5ff8e21250e33670924a0c5e38f47c840b/launcher.jar).
3. Download and run Minecraft. You can likely run up to 17w06a/1.11.2 however if those versions have issues run 1.7.2 or older.

## Modified OS Steps (With KernelEx, Java 8 patches, and Java 8)
1. Download java 8 from anywhere where it's available.
2. Download a patched version of the official Minecraft Launcher from here or download Betacraft from [here](https://github.com/Moresteck/BetaCraft-Launcher-Java/releases).
3. Download and run Minecraft. 1.16.5 has been shown to run fine on Windows 98 in the past, however you might run into issues with your gpu being too old. If so try 1.12.2, and if that doesn't work, 1.7.2.
